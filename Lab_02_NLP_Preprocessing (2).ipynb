        "**Before we start coding, think about your daily interactions with text processing systems (search engines, chatbots, translation apps). What challenges do you think these systems face when processing human language? List at least 3 specific challenges and explain why each is problematic.**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Double-click this cell to write your answer:*\n",

        "**Challenge 1:** Translation apps do not always guve the best meaning for certain words. For example, some English words do not translate to the meaning intended when trying to get a Spanish translation. Translation apps focus more on proper dialect while most human conversations do not follow the same rules. This causes issue when trying to have a real life conversation witht the help of translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenge 2:** Search engines have the ability to process human language, but sometimes does not understand the context of what is being typed. They require a bit more direction on what specifically is being asked. For example, googling certain locations for food will pop up information from all over, so it promts to share location in order to get more specific information. This can create issues when location cannot be shared.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenge 3:** Chatbots summarize a lot of sources to come up with a few answers. It is usefull for needing to filter through many sources with short descriptions of what they offer. Though there is a lot of good use for it, unfortunately it does not always give the exact answer that you are looking for. I believe it has so many different options to give as a reply, therefore you have to ask a few follow up questions to get a deeper answer.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Another challenge I see happening involve words needing to be captitalized in certain text, while in others needing to be left lowercase. An example being \"sergeant\" being used as a common noun and remaining lowercased. While if \"Sergeant\" is followed with a name, then it becomes a capitalized word. This can become problematic whenver there are many rules in the human language to follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Academic text challenges:**\n",
        "1. Academic text usually has more advanced language used. The format is different along with the content included. Even in different areas of study, the format may be similar along with the words, but the context can be regarding an entirely different subject. This is problematic for NLP analysis as it may need more direction to get the results desired.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. These text also include citations which can become tricky whenever you are tyoing a paper and it autocorrects to something that seems more gramatically correct. This makes the attention to detail important whenever writing any type of paper on a word processor.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Social media text challenges:**\n",
        "1. There are many forms of communication on social media, including hashtags, emojis, slang, videos and more. The example above in \"Load Sample Text\" shows \"OMG\" which makes the text processing unreliable. Along with the continuous use of capital letters in the sentence which can also disrupt text processing abilities.\n",
        "2. The example above also uses hashtags and emojis which are not included in the traditional text category. It can be problematic whenever te model is trying to process it as something important or ignorable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**News text challenges:**\n",
        "1. News text can pose challenges whenever the news topic becomes worldwide knowledge. There can be many different articles in different languages which makes reporting on certain topics a bit harder. It can be an article being translated via an online translator and the model may not give the correct translation. This can lead to misinformation being reported on worldwide.\n",
        "2. When searching for specific news articles, it can be hard to find the right one due to misleading titles. The use of the titles puts that website into a generalized category of what seems similar. It is hard for the models to filter out past the plain text due to it not being aware of the click bait mentality humans have.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Product review challenges:**\n",
        "1. Reviews online are sketchy due to the inability to always differentiate a review completed by a human versus one that was made by bots. The lack of ability to filter them out is due to NLP not seeing the two as different. This can lead to a problematic experience for customers purchasing based on written online reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. There is a struggle for NLP to recognize words that have been created over the past few years in the slang department. Sometimes to relate to more people on social media, there is slang used in reviews to make a connection to another reader. It shows authenticity to humans while still making it difficult for the NLP model to understand.\n",

        "\n",
        "**1. Most affected text type:**\n",
        "Informal text types are the most affected by preprocessing. This is due to the high usage of slang, run on sentences, emojis, hashtags, and trendy phrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Least affected text type:**\n",
        "Least affected types would be formal text types. These text tend to have less noise and stop words in the writings. This allows for low usages of reduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. For customer review analysis:**\n",
        "For the use of NLP in customer servce reviews, lemmatization is better. This is due to the ability to retain the meaning of what is being said. It also allows room for stop words that are crucial to understanding to be kept. More sentiment analysis creates a better customer service experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Main trade-offs to consider:**\n",
        "For NLP projects, there is a lot of consideration needed for preprocessing techniques. The risks at hand include choose between speed or accuracy, sentiment analysis, over-cleaning, and context of the field the project is being used for. All of these factors need to be considered while deciding what to use for each situation.\n",
