Throughout this project of NLP processing techniques, I gained a great understanding of the critical role of preprocessing in NLP pipelines. I gained more skills in fundamental text preprocessing techniques. 
I showcased the comparison of different libraries and their approaches along with the analysis of the effects of preprocessing on text data.  
By the end of this project I built a preprocessing pipeline and loaded/worked on different datasets.
